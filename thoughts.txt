1. who interacts with the system?
	student:- yes(for checking displayed reports of their performance and adding courses, deleting courses,etc)
	teachers:- yes(for checking performances of the students enrolled for their particular course, as in the performance of the students for the course that teacher teaches)
	admins:- (don't understand their roles for any system)
	operator:- don't need them. (students and teachers can do that)

2. main goal?
	to manage academic records records of the students and based on those records we can track their performances

3. performace metrics:- total number of assignments completed on time, marks for the assignments and internal and external tests, and the attendance of the student.

4. Analysis Depth:- just show averages and trends, and also make insights (like “top-performing students,” “weak areas per subject,” etc.)

5. Scope Boundary:- only one semester for now, may proceed with multiple semester in the foreseeable future

6. persistence and access:- if it is easy to export to such formats then sure. but for now let's just use postgres as our main datastore 

7. CLI behaviour:- 
	menu driven or command-driven (one is more user-friendly and the other is more soffisticated), 
	also i was wondering if i should use cpp for this instead of python.
	i chose python cause it could be used on backend, but for the CLI cpp seems more appropriate
